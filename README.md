# Mini-Instagram

## Introduction

Instagram is an application I use a lot. I love to share my life, connect with friends, and discover interesting contents posted by people around the world. At times, I still feel that Instagram can be improved on a few aspects. For example, I never feel comfortable about the algorithm behind my feed. Specifically, I would like to see the posts in chronological order, rather than them being sorting by an ambiguous algorithm, which leads to another issue. Once my followings are in the hundreds, I can hardly see the updates from accounts that I'm most interested in.

So, instead of waiting for Instagram to solve its issues, I decided to do it myself. Here's my version of Instagram. In addition to typical Instagram functionality, where users can 

- follow their friends
- post images and videos
- like and comment a post
- etc.

in my app, a user can also organize the followings into different groups, e.g. Sports, Celebrities, Friends, or News. On a user's feed, the user can choose to display posts from all followings or from a specific group, *all in chronological order*.

This project is a good opportunity for me to practice software design principles and object-oriented design that I learned from school, and to challenge myself to learn something that is completely new to me. For example, Android Studio for app development, Firebase Authentication for user registration and login, Cloud Storage for Firebase to store multimedia, Firebase Realtime Database to hold all users' data.
