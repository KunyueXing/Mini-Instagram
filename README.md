# Mini-Instagram

## Introduction

This is an Instagram-like Android application where users can register and login, post images, like and comment on other 
users' posts, organize following into groups, and display posts from a specific group. \
\
The application deployed Firebase Storage and Realtime Database to store application data. \
\
This is a side project to practice object-oriented design, Android application development, Google Firebase services.

Instagram is an application I used a lot. I love to share my life, connect with friends, and discover interesting contents posted by people around the world. At times, I still feel that Instagram can be improved on a few aspects. For example, I never feel comfortable about the algorithm behind my feed. Specifically, I would like to see the posts in chronological order, rather than them being sorting by an ambiguous algorithm, which leads to another issue. Once my followings are in the hundreds, I can hardly see the updates from accounts that I'm most interested in.

So, instead of waiting for Instagram to solve its issues, I decided to do it myself. Here's my version of Instagram. In addition to typical Instagram functionality, where users can 

- follow their friends
- post images and videos
- like and comment a post
- etc.

in my app, a user can also organize the followings into different groups, e.g. Sports, Celebrities, Friends, or News. On a user's feed, the user can choose to display posts from all followings or from a specific group, *all in chronological order*.
